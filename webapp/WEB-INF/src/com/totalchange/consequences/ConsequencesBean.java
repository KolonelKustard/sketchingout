 * <p>This bean is a simple user id generator.  At present it does nothing other 
 * than generate a new user id if one isn't passed in a cookie.  There is no need 
 * at present to do any database mangling in this call as will automatically create
 * a new user record in the database on the first submission from the client.</p>
 * <p>The main point of the bean is to provide an id (existing or new) to the
 * Flash movie so it has a point of reference.  May decide to secure this a little
 * more later on by doing a database check.  But it seems pretty pointless at
 * present to try and tackle spoofing.  In fact it may prove quite amusing if
 * some little punk does decide to spoof others.</p>
